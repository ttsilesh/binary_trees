This project is mainly on Binary trees. This helps to create a binary tree node, to insert or delet node in a binary tree, to check a node in a binary tree wheather a leaf or root node. And also shows how to make pre-order traversal, in-order traversal, and post-order traversal. the code includes to find height of a binary tree  and depth of a node in a binary tree, etc.
